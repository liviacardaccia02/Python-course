# 🐍 Python Course

## 📖 Introduction

This repository collects the **exercises and laboratories** developed during the **Python course** at **Université Côte d'Azur**.

It is structured into different folders, each corresponding to a laboratory session, covering topics ranging from basic syntax to more advanced programming concepts.

> 🧠 *These are the exercises for the 2025/2026 Python Course, developed by Livia Cardaccia.*

## 📂 Repository Structure

The project is organized into numbered folders, each containing scripts and solutions for specific laboratory sessions:

* **lab1** — Introduction to Python syntax and basic operations.
* **lab2** — Graph operations using dictionaries, sets and lambas.
* **lab3** — Overview of OOP in Python.
* **lab4** — Advanced exercises and data structures.

## ⚙️ Requirements

The code is written in **Python 3**. To run the scripts, you need an up-to-date Python interpreter installed.

### 🔹 Check Version
You can verify your Python version with the following command:
```
    python3 --version
```

## 🚀 Running the Exercises
You can execute individual scripts directly from the terminal.

### 🔹 Example Commands
To run a specific exercise (e.g., inside the lab1 folder):
```
    cd lab1
    python3 exercise_name.py
```
  
Or from the root of the repository:
```
    python3 lab1/exercise_name.py
```

>⚠️ Make sure you are in the correct directory or provide the correct relative path for any input/output files.
